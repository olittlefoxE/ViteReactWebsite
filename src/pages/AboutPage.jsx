              Our goal is to use this website as a platform to deepen our
              knowledge of HTML, CSS, React, and the intricacies of web
              development, including how to set up, run, and maintain a website.
              <br />
              <br />
              Through this project, we aim to showcase our programming skills by
              presenting various projects we&aposve developed in multiple
              programming languages. You can learn about many different
              languages in the &aposLanguages&apos part including info about its
              Founders and year of founding, its purpose and key features and
              some related languages.

              This is our first professional public website. It&apos;s a hobby
              project born from our shared interest in programming and web
              development. We hope you enjoy exploring it as much as we enjoyed
              creating it!
